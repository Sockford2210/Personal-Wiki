=====Python Virtual Environment=====
A virtual environment in Python is an isolated environment on your computer, where you can run and test your Python projects.

It allows you to manage project-specific dependencies without interfering with other projects or the original Python installation.

Think of a virtual environment as a separate container for each Python project. Each container:
  * Has its own Python interpreter
  * Has its own set of installed packages
  * Is isolated from other virtual environments
  * Can have different versions of the same package

Using virtual environments is important because:
  * It prevents package version conflicts between projects
  * Makes projects more portable and reproducible
  * Keeps your system Python installation clean
  * Allows testing with different Python versions

====Setup====
===Windows===
To set up a new virual environment in windows:
Open a new terminal and run:
<code>python -m venv .venv</code>

This will create a new folder '.venv' for your virtual environment.
You can then activate the virtual environment by:
<code>
.venv\scripts\activate
</code>

Then when inside the virtual environment install packages using pip and run scripts as you would normally.
