<p>
Docker allows &#039;containers&#039; to be created acting as stripped down virtual machines, which can be used to run applications.
Internal docker networks can be configured to allow containers to talk to each other, this makes them useful for creating a simulated environment. 
</p>

<p>
Containers remove the <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> layer dependency of an application, therefore applications configured to run in containers can run in a docker container on any environment (provided docker is running on that environment).
</p>

<p>
For example, a containerised website can run in docker on both the development machine in containers and in an Azure app service configured to run docker.
</p>

<p>
Docker containers are built from &#039;Images&#039; much the same way as virtual machine may be started from an <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> snapshot
