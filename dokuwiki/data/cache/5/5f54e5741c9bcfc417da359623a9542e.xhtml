Kubernetes is a container-orechestration system.
</p>

<p>
It allows for the management of multiple containers(nodes) across different computers as a single unit. This single unit is the &#039;cluster&#039;, and the management of nodes is performed through a &#039;control plane&#039;.

##Control Plane
The Control Plane is responsible for managing the cluster. The Control Plane coordinates all activities in your cluster, such as scheduling applications, maintaining applications&#039; desired state, scaling applications, and rolling out new updates.
</p>

<p>
##Node
A node is a VM or a physical computer that serves as a worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster. Each node has a Kubelet, which is an agent for managing the node and communicating with the Kubernetes control plane. The node should also have tools for handling container operations, such as containerd or CRI-O.
