The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) is the runtime engine that executes Python code. It&#039;s essentially a program that interprets and executes bytecode, which is an intermediate representation of Python source code.
It serves as an abstraction layer between the Python bytecode and the underlying hardware, providing a consistent environment for running Python programs across different platforms; so similar to the Java Virtual Machine, it allows you to write python scripts agnostically of the underlying system running them. 
The Python VM is implemented in CPython, the reference implementation of Python.
